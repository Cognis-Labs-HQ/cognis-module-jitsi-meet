# Invite participants to active meetings

**Feature Branch:** work

## Extend active non-disposable meetings

Participants can now be dragged into an active meeting that began with invitees. The meeting membership and encrypted Messages chat are updated, the new participant receives an invitation, and they can claim the meeting password when joining. Staged participants are not returned to the available list after the meeting starts.

## Keep active meeting surfaces usable

Participant refreshes no longer reopen the lobby overlay over a joined meeting, so notification and active-list joins remain usable. The available participant column now displays “No available participants.” when empty.

## Reveal the active participant dropzone

Dragging an available participant now temporarily reveals a localized drop target over an eligible active meeting window. Dropping invites the participant, while ending the drag restores the uninterrupted meeting view.
