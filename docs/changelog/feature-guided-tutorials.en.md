# Guided tutorial

**Feature Branch:** feature-guided-tutorials

## Technical Specification

The play introduces meetings and staged participants without joining or creating a meeting. It requires an authenticated online session.

The module registers its own play and localized strings through ctx. The host owns the catalog, callouts, arrows, spotlight, keyboard and pointer controls, guarded SPA navigation and accessibility. Closing a tutorial, navigating away, losing access or disabling the module releases the session. Failed provider mounting rolls back its registrations.

Provider tests check the public contract, all four translations, availability rules, rollback and rejection of unsupported host versions.

## Page-bound First Visits

The host owns callouts, arrows, spotlight, accessibility and the shared floating action menu. First-time runs offer Next throughout, without Cancel or Skip. Replays offer Cancel with `btn-cancel`. Completion is stored per account in the browser. Navigation, access loss and provider removal release the session; failed mounts roll back registrations.

## Page Guides

Coverage includes meeting preparation, live call/chat/sharing controls, and administrator-only inspection and termination/deletion review.

## Descriptive Tutorial Keys

Tutorial step translation keys and target identifiers describe their subject instead of their position in the guide. The same keys are supplied in all four supported languages.

## Actionable Tutorial Copy

Tutorial steps focus on the controls and tasks available on the page, without unrelated reassurances about permissions or actions the guide does not perform.

## Author Next cues per step

Each tutorial step now explicitly declares `highlightNext`: explanations that require Next or Finish enable it, while interaction- and wait-driven exercises disable it. The cue retains a static outline for reduced motion.

Tutorial coverage is required for every UI-facing component. Contributor guidance requires user-first, task-focused walkthroughs and a review of existing tutorials whenever features or UI behavior change.
